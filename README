DBIx-MyParsePP version 0.10
===========================

This pure-Perl module implements a SQL parser by compiling the YACC grammer from
MySQL with Parse::YAPP. A lexer has been written in perl that is identical
to the lexer from MySQL.

Please note that this module is not identical to DBIx::MyParse -- the method
for creating the parse tree is wildly different.
